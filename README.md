# My NixOS Configuration
This is work in progress!

## First installation
run `install.sh` before first rebuild

## Username
The username module makes it easier to change the username for the system.
It also allows others to adapt this configuration for their own system.
However, there are still some absolute paths, that are relying on the username `tilman`. 
So be careful if you want to copy this configuration.
